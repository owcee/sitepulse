You are designing the complete UI/UX for "SitePulse" – a mobile-based construction task monitoring, delay prediction, resource management, and group chat application for small to mid-scale construction projects.

==================================================================
IMPORTANT INSTRUCTION
==================================================================
Only build the **frontend UI/UX** in **React (React Native for mobile)** at this stage. 
Do **not** implement backend logic, APIs, or Firebase/TensorFlow Lite integration yet.
However, ensure all components, screens, and data structures are designed to be fully compatible with:
- Firebase Firestore
- Firebase Authentication
- Firebase Cloud Functions
- Firebase Cloud Messaging
- TensorFlow Lite (MobileNetV3 CNN & Linear Regression)

==================================================================
TECH STACK (for compatibility)
==================================================================
- **Frontend**: React (React Native for mobile)
- **Backend** (future integration): Firebase / Firestore for authentication, real-time sync, resource management, and group chat
- **Machine Learning** (future integration): TensorFlow Lite for:
    - CNN (MobileNetV3) for task image classification
    - Linear Regression for delay prediction
- **Resource Management & Chat**: Firestore collections with Cloud Functions triggers and push notifications

==================================================================
ROLE 1: ENGINEER / PROJECT MANAGER UI/UX
==================================================================

### GENERAL LAYOUT
- **Primary Navigation (Bottom Tab Bar)**:
  1. Dashboard
  2. Tasks
  3. Delay Prediction
  4. Resources
  5. Chat

- **Top Navigation Bar**:
  - Project Selector (dropdown for switching projects)
  - Profile icon with quick settings

---

### 1. DASHBOARD SCREEN
- **Task Status Summary**: % of Not Started, In Progress, Completed (color-coded)
- **Latest Photos**: thumbnails of recent worker uploads with CNN classification + verification status
- **Delay Risk**: chart showing estimated completion date & delay warnings
- **Resource Snapshot**: budget spent vs remaining, payroll summary, inventory alerts
- **Unread Messages Badge** from chat

---

### 2. TASKS MODULE
- **Task List View**:
  - Filters: All, Not Started, In Progress, Completed
  - Each card: title, CNN classification, verification status, last update
- **Task Detail View**:
  - Large photo preview
  - CNN classification result
  - Verification controls: Approve ✅ / Reject ❌ / Reclassify dropdown
  - Notes input for feedback
- All screens styled for mobile use in the field

---

### 3. DELAY PREDICTION MODULE
- Progress timeline chart
- Predicted delay result from Linear Regression (future integration)
- Factors influencing prediction
- Export PDF button

---

### 4. RESOURCE MANAGEMENT MODULE
**Tabs:**
- Budget: total, spent, remaining (pie chart/bar chart)
- Payroll: list of workers, hours worked, wages
- Inventory: stock list, reorder alerts (red highlight for low stock)

---

### 5. GROUP CHAT MODULE
- Per-project chat rooms
- Message cards: sender name, role, timestamp, text/image/file
- Badge notifications for unread messages

---

==================================================================
ROLE 2: WORKER UI/UX
==================================================================

### GENERAL LAYOUT
- **Primary Navigation (Bottom Tab Bar)**:
  1. Tasks
  2. Upload Photo
  3. Chat
  4. Notifications
  5. Profile

---

### 1. TASKS MODULE
- Task List View:
  - Assigned tasks only
  - Status icons (gray/yellow/green)
  - Due date + short description
- Task Detail View:
  - Instructions
  - Last approved photo from engineer
  - Upload new photo option

---

### 2. UPLOAD PHOTO MODULE
- Camera integration
- After capture:
  - CNN (MobileNetV3) runs locally (future backend integration)
  - Display classification result instantly
  - Notes input
  - Submit button sends for engineer review
- Show “Pending Verification” until approved

---

### 3. GROUP CHAT MODULE
- Same project chat as engineer side
- Workers can send messages, questions, and images

---

### 4. NOTIFICATIONS MODULE
- Task approvals/rejections
- Delay warnings
- Material/resource alerts

---

### 5. PROFILE MODULE
- Name, role, assigned project
- Hours worked (synced from payroll)
- Payroll summary (read-only)
- Manager contact info

==================================================================
UI DESIGN GUIDELINES (BOTH ROLES)
==================================================================
- **Color Coding**: Red = urgent, Yellow = warning, Green = complete
- **Fonts**: Roboto or Inter for outdoor readability
- **Buttons**: Large, touch-friendly for gloved hands
- **Dark Mode**: Optional
- **Offline Caching**: For photo uploads & chat messages
- **Push Notifications**: Placeholder UI for future Firebase integration
- **Data Sync**: Placeholder UI for future Firestore integration
